Mango ML

Description:

Mango ML is a machine learning project designed to accurately determine the ripeness of mangoes using computer vision techniques. The system analyzes images of mangoes and categorizes them into different ripeness stages, including ripe, early ripe, partially ripe, overripe, unripe, and not mango. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, Mango ML offers a convenient and efficient solution for farmers, distributors, and retailers to assess the quality and ripeness of mangoes. The project includes a Flask web application for easy interaction, allowing users to upload mango images and receive real-time predictions regarding their ripeness stage. Additionally, Mango ML is containerized using Docker, providing a portable and scalable deployment option for various environments.

Features:

Automatic ripeness detection of mangoes using machine learning algorithms.
Support for multiple ripeness stages, including ripe, early ripe, partially ripe, overripe, unripe, and not mango.
User-friendly web interface powered by Flask, enabling easy uploading and prediction of mango images.
Utilization of computer vision techniques for accurate analysis and classification of mangoes based on image features.
Dockerized deployment for easy setup and scalability across different environments.
Usage:

Upload mango images: Users can upload images of mangoes via the web interface.
Receive ripeness predictions: The system processes the uploaded images and provides real-time predictions regarding the ripeness stage of the mangoes.
Visualize results: Users can view the predicted ripeness stage of the mangoes along with the uploaded images for validation and decision-making purposes.
